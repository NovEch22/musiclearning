<h1>Music Learning</h1>
<p>This is a personal 'blog' *throws up in mouth a little to help me learn music theory, eapecially as it related to the guitar and 5 string banjo. 
<br>
I want to cover everything from scales and keys to the infamous circle of 5ths and have it here so I can use it as a reference written in my own words when I'm not at my computer.
